# Documentation Index

**Last reviewed:** 2026-02-15

This index classifies docs by current usage so contributors can quickly identify canonical sources vs. historical context.

## Start Here (LLM Onboarding)

- `docs/LLM_ONBOARDING.md` — **Quick architecture overview** (5 min read). Start here.
- `docs/NEW_GAME_GUIDE.md` — **Step-by-step guide** for implementing a new multiplayer game.

## Canonical (Current)

- `README.md` — Project overview, setup, and core commands.
- `CLAUDE.md` — Working context and conventions for coding sessions.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Canonical shared multiplayer flow reference, new-game checklist, and scale TODO backlog.
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_MULTIPLAYER_ALIGNMENT.md` — Canonical execution plan and completion evidence.

## Historical / Superseded Planning

- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Original single-game MVP checklist (legacy).
- `requirements.md` — Original MVP requirements for early Euchre-only scope.
- `docs/roadmap_codex.md` — Archived planning variant (historical traceability only).
- `docs/roadmap_grok.md` — Archived planning variant (historical traceability only).
- `docs/MULTIPLAYER_REQUIREMENTS.md` — Pre-implementation multiplayer requirements draft.
- `docs/CODE_REVIEW.md` — Point-in-time code review snapshot.

## Reference Architecture

- `docs/MULTIPLAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Detailed architecture guide; useful reference, but parts reflect pre-Phase-3 patterns.

## Research Artifacts

- `docs/RESEARCH_PROPOSAL_DRAFT.md`
- `docs/RESEARCH_PROPOSAL_v2.md`
- `docs/RESEARCH_TASK_UX_COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md`
- `research/competitive-analysis.md`
- `research/screenshot-sources.md`

## Maintenance Rule

When architecture or phase status changes, update these first:

1. `docs/ROADMAP.md`
2. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_MULTIPLAYER_ALIGNMENT.md`
3. `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
4. `README.md` (if setup or command flow changed)
