# UX/UI Competitor Research Task

## Objective
Analyze successful (and unsuccessful) card game apps to extract UX patterns, validate tech decisions, and identify differentiation opportunities for 67cardgames.com.

---

## Research Areas

### 1. Visual Design & Layout Patterns

**Questions to answer:**
- How do top apps arrange players around the board? (2-player, 4-player, 6-player)
- Where is the player's hand positioned? How much screen real estate?
- How are opponents represented? (avatars, card backs, plaques, minimal)
- What info is always visible vs. on-demand?
- How do they handle landscape vs. portrait?

**Apps to analyze:**
- Poker: PokerStars, WSOP, Zynga Poker
- Solitaire: Solitaire by MobilityWare, Microsoft Solitaire
- Casual cards: Uno, Exploding Kittens
- CCG/premium: Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra, Balatro
- Traditional: Spades Royale, Euchre 3D, Trickster Cards

**Deliverable:** Layout pattern matrix with screenshots/sketches

### 2. Animations & Feedback

**Questions to answer:**
- What animations are universal? (deal, play, collect)
- What timing feels "right"? (snappy vs. luxurious)
- How is turn indication handled?
- What audio/haptic feedback is used?
- What makes interactions feel "juicy"?

**Method:**
- YouTube gameplay videos (slow-mo analysis)
- App Store preview videos
- Design teardown articles

**Deliverable:** Animation inventory with timing notes

---

### 3. Social/Chat Features

**Questions to answer:**
- Which apps have chat? Text, emotes, voice?
- Is chat actually used? (check reviews, Reddit)
- Do people LIKE the social features or complain about toxicity?
- How do they handle moderation?
- Are there "quick chat" or canned responses?

**Review mining keywords:**
- "chat", "emotes", "toxic", "friendly", "community", "social"

**Deliverable:** Social features matrix + sentiment summary

---

### 4. Onboarding & Friction

**Questions to answer:**
- How many taps to first game?
- Account required? Guest play?
- Tutorial: forced, skippable, contextual?
- What causes 1-star "couldn't figure it out" reviews?

**Deliverable:** Onboarding friction audit

---

### 5. Tech Stack & PWA Viability

**Questions to answer:**
- Are there successful PWA card/board games?
- What do reviews say about "install" friction?
- Native vs. web - does performance get mentioned in reviews?
- Cross-platform play - is this a selling point?

**Research sources:**
- PWA case studies (web.dev, dev.to)
- "PWA game" success stories
- App Store reviews mentioning "web", "browser", "install"

**Steve's PWA thesis to validate/challenge:**
> PWA is a differentiator. High onboarding friction due to unfamiliarity, but uniqueness could be a niche positive - foothold vs. drowning in App Store sea.

**Sub-questions:**
- What % of users understand "Add to Home Screen"?
- Do PWAs rank/surface differently than native apps?
- Are there SEO/discoverability advantages?
- What's the abandonment rate for PWA install flow?

**Deliverable:** PWA viability assessment with evidence

### 6. Monetization & Ads

**Questions to answer:**
- How do top free apps monetize without being obnoxious?
- What ad placements are tolerable vs. hated?
- What's the sweet spot for "remove ads" pricing?
- Cosmetics, coins, premium features - what works?

**Review mining keywords:**
- "ads", "pay to win", "fair", "worth it", "too expensive"

**Deliverable:** Monetization pattern notes

---

### 7. What Makes Apps FAIL (UX Anti-patterns)

**Method:**
- 1-2 star reviews on popular apps (filter for UX complaints)
- Reddit threads: "why I quit X", "worst card game apps"
- Apps with high download count but low ratings (bait & switch?)

**Common complaints to categorize:**
- Confusing UI
- Forced tutorials
- Can't find games/friends
- Laggy/unresponsive
- Aggressive monetization
- No offline play

**Deliverable:** Anti-pattern list with examples
