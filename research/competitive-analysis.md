## 🔥 What People HATE (Pain Points)

### Monetization Hell
- **Ads interrupting gameplay** - ads pop up MID-HAND in some apps (Zynga)
- **Coin systems** - Having to "buy in" with fake currency that runs out
- **Pay-to-win disguised as free** - Free to download, impossible to enjoy without paying
- **No way to pay once for ad-free** - subscription-only or no option at all

### Bad AI Partners
- **AI doesn't play smart** - Euchre 3D bots are infamous ("obligatory monthly 3D bots suck post")
- **AI doesn't signal properly** - Doesn't follow basic partner communication strategies
- **No skill levels** - Can't adjust AI difficulty to match your skill

### Rigged Feeling
- **Too many dramatic hands** - Four flushes, one-liner straights constantly
- **Suspicion of rigging** - Zynga especially has endless "rigged" complaints
- **Algorithm feels punishing** - "I win too much, then suddenly can't win anything"

### Poor Online Experience
- **Partners leaving mid-game** - Then you're stuck with bad AI
- **Rating penalties unfair** - Lose points when YOUR partner quits
- **Chat toxicity** - No good way to block or disable
- **Disconnection issues** - Games voided, pots lost

### UI/UX Frustrations
- **Too many cards on screen** - Overwhelming for some games
- **Can't customize controls** - Left-handed mode rare
- **Clunky bet controls** - Can't set preferred bet percentages
- **Only see last 1 hand** - No meaningful hand history

### Missing Features People Want
- **Offline mode** - Many require internet even for single player
- **Stats tracking** - People want to see their improvement
- **Rule variations** - Locked to one ruleset

## 🎯 Opportunity Gaps

Based on Reddit complaints, there's clear demand for:

1. **An honest free-to-play model** - No gambling psychology, no fake currency drain
2. **Actually good AI** - That plays smart and signals like a real partner
3. **Fair online play** - Handle disconnects gracefully, don't punish victims
4. **Respectful monetization** - Pay once, own it. Or free with non-intrusive ads
5. **Multi-game apps done right** - Most multi-game apps are bloated. Clean execution rare.
